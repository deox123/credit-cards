## TODO

-   absolute imports instead of relative
-   improve fields validation (date input validation is so unreliable, also validation message should appear only if there is an error, excluding length validation, which should be shown only in case of reaching the input length limit)
-   improve accessibility (currently accessibility is tightly coupled with our html structure)
-   extract some of data transformation logic from components
-   styling improvements (make it more mobile friendly, responsible, add brakepoints etc)
-   tests
